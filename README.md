# Build a Family Movie Watchlist API

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis-v9/lab-family-movie-watchlist-api/build-a-family-movie-watchlist-api

Install your project dependencies by entering `npm i` from the `build-a-family-movie-watchlist-api/` folder in the terminal.

Seeded data in `./data/` has been provided, and does not need to be manually edited.

Functions in `./utils/db.js` have been provided for working with the watchlist. No more need to be created.

**Objective**: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
